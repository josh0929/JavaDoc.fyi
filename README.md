# JavaDoc.fyi

Simple Java documentation website, similar to the actual Java Platform API Specification site (commonly refered to as Javadoc) 
created using java backend (ofcourse) and advanced implementations of multiple data structures combined (Hashtables, Trees, Linked-lists)
in order to integrate fast and efficient searching capabilities to the site.

Purpose:
  1. Create a portal where I can group all documents I have gathered 
  throughout my college tenure regarding Programming languages (mainly
  java) and access it quickly when in doubt.
  
  2. Implement a searching algorithm similar to the Apache Lucene | Elastic
  searching algo used to index large amounts of textual data and efficiently
  and rapidly return when invoked.

Frameworks & Tools:
  - Java
  - Tomcat Server
  - Bootstrap
